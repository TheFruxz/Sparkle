# â›“ Types

{% hint style="warning" %}
This page is a general description, of each type
{% endhint %}

There are several types of Effects so every type of effect is covered by a groupable interface. These interfaces are helping us, to give every effect the boundaries, which fit them the most.

## The structure

Here you can see the structure of the effects interfaces:

But this is not all, because we use these effect interfaces in the code of Sparkle. With all these the interfaces are linked into the deepest code, but take a look:
