# ðŸ–¥ For server owners

Dear server owner!

You may have heard about Sparkle, or your developers wanted to implement Sparkle into their projects. But what is Sparkle?

Sparkle helps your developers to create resistent, reliable, and powerful plugins for your Paper (or above) Servers. With robust APIs and reliable structures, Sparkle helps as an underlying system, to provide these things.

To let everything happen, Sparkle, as a plugin, must run on the Server itself. Maybe you would say, this is kind of sus, but Sparkle itself is like a Platform. You can manage Tasks of different plugins, manage them, manage their components, and much more. This is the reason, why Sparkle should be installed on your Server.

If you want to learn, how you can install Sparkle on your server, visit the [Installation](../installation.md) page!
