# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» For developers

Dear plugin developer!

Sometimes it is quite complicated or disturbing to work with the APIs and frameworks, which are currently out on the market.

With Sparkle you can easily create robust and reliable plugins, without having to worry too much about aspects of the things, nobody wants to think of.

In Sparkle, we work on an async basis, with kotlin libraries in mind. Most things are directly attached to Kotlin coroutines and are designed, to work well with most things, you can think of.

From the creation of user interfaces to the management of plugin components, Sparkle has an explicit and straightforward answer to it!

Give Sparkle a try and use it in one of your projects! Visit the [Installation](../installation.md#install-it-in-your-project) page to start working with Sparkle, the Framework you want to work with!
