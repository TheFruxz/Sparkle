# ðŸ–¨ Interchanges

Interchanges can quite simply translate to commands with automation and systems hidden in the background, to ensure a good user experience.

They help to easily construct heavy and complicated structures without having to look at cluttered code or needing a master's degree in science and space engineering.

This does not mean, that you can't develop systems, which requires a master's degree, but this system itself is not requiring it. Interchanges do not limit your usage of commands.&#x20;
